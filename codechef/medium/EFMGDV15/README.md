### Print Student Names

To enhance your knowledge on traversing  **collections**  work on this school management system problem. You are given a `Student`  **class**  with `name` and `age`. In `Main` class we are creating Student object based on user input and adding those to `ArrayList`, you will be traversing those.

Task to Perform:

- Create an ArrayList named students that will store Student objects.
- After all inputs are received, traverse the students ArrayList and print the name of each student using the getName method.
### Sample 1:

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int n = sc.nextInt();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            String name = sc.next();

            int age = sc.nextInt();

            students.add(new Student(name, age));
        }

        System.out.println("\nStudent Names:");
        for (Student student : students) {
            System.out.println(student.getName());
        }
