## Problem

### Double the Numbers

Given an array of numbers, create a new array where each number is double the value of the corresponding number in the original array. Note: While `map` is often preferred for creating new arrays, this exercise shows how you can achieve it using `forEach` and an external array.

### Sample 1:

```
[1, 5, 10]

Doubled: [ 2, 10, 20 ]
```

```js
let originalNumbers = [1, 5, 10];

// Create an empty array to store the results
let doubledNumbers=[];
originalNumbers.forEach(num=>{doubledNumbers.push(num*2);});
// Iterate over the original numbers

// Calculate the doubled value

// Add the doubled value to our new array


console.log("Doubled:" ,doubledNumbers);
```
