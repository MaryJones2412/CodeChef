    }

        Song song3 = new Song("Hotel California", "The Eagles");

        playlist.add(song1);
        playlist.add(song2);
        playlist.add(song3);

        // Display the playlist
        System.out.println("My Playlist:");
        Song song = playlist.get(0);
        System.out.println((1) + ". " + song.getTitle() + " by " + song.getArtist());
        song = playlist.get(1);
        System.out.println((2) + ". " + song.getTitle() + " by " + song.getArtist());
        song = playlist.get(2);
